\begin{abstract}
This paper will primiarly focus on the possible consequenses of considering geothermal gradient when attempting to optimize the geothermal borehole heat exchangers. Based on previous studies on the distributed thermal response test, an adaptation of an existing analytical solution of coaxial borehole heat exchanger (CBHE) is proposed. We believe it is crucial to estimate the added thermal benefit from geothermal gradient, especially when there are needs to achieve better thermal performance of the boreholes. Understanding the growing demand of geothermal energy for district systems, this paper examines the possibility of incorporating the geothermal gradient in estimating the performance of borehole heat exchangers, and subsequently the optimization of borehole heat exchanger configurations through the proposed analytical model. According to our results, the adapted analytical model was adequate to estimate the thermal responses from the test well, and can be used as a tool to estimate different coaxial borehole heat exchanger configurations. We estimate adding insulation and changing diameters of CBHEs could improve the heat extraction by up to 60\%(What's the actual number?).\end{abstract}
