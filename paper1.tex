\begin{abstract}

To understand the thermal responses of deeper geothermal boreholes, we propose an adapted version of an analytical solution that incorporates the undisturbed ground temperature as an input variable. We validated the adapted coaxial borehole heat exchanger (CBHE) model against data collected during a recent thermal response test, and conducted parametric analysis on how changing the configuration, level of insulation, and environmental parameters such as the geothermal gradient and thermal conductivities may affect the results of the thermal response test. We found that design parameters that alters the shunt resistance ($R_{12}$) can affect the resulting thermal responses from the CBHE significantly. This includes the level of insulation, configuration (diameters and cross-section area ratios of inner pipe and annulus) as well as the linear flow rates at the heat exchanger inner and outer pipe walls. We believe these results are important to report, since they contradict directly with the current practice of sizing and designing  CBHEs. Further investigations focusing on delivering higher enthalpy geothermal energy from larger depths or modifying the temperature distribution along the depth of CBHEs may help expanding the conclusions in this paper.

%This paper will primiarly focus on the possible consequenses of considering geothermal gradient when attempting to optimize geothermal borehole heat exchangers. Based on previous analytical models describing CBHE responses during thermal response tests, we propose an adaptation of the analytical solution for coaxial borehole heat exchanger performance. We believe it is crucial to estimate the added thermal benefit from geothermal gradient, especially when there are needs to achieve better thermal performance of the boreholes. Understanding the growing demand of geothermal energy for district systems, this paper examines the possibility of incorporating the geothermal gradient in estimating the performance of borehole heat exchangers, and subsequently the optimization of borehole heat exchanger configurations through the proposed analytical model. According to our results, the adapted analytical model was adequate to estimate the thermal responses from the test well, and can be used as a tool to estimate different coaxial borehole heat exchanger configurations. We estimate adding insulation and changing diameters of CBHEs could improve the heat extraction by up to 60\%(What's the actual number?).
