	abstract = {In-situ thermal response tests (TRT) have been carried out on six boreholes in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at the Hope Crossing (Habitat for Humanity) site. The set of boreholes include coaxial and double U-tube heat exchangers, as well as conventional U-tube heat exchangers. This TRT study is a part of a larger project, where the boreholes are connected to ground source heat pumps to cool and heat homes. The TRT study is the first part of a larger project to evaluate the thermal performance of different types of ground heat exchangers. The TRT tests and subsequent data analyses provide estimates of the soil thermal conductivity and the borehole thermal resistance of each heat exchanger. Potentially the borehole depth and/or number of boreholes can be reduced for an installation if the borehole resistance is lowered. The double U- tube heat exchanger with enhanced grout has the lowest borehole resistance, followed by a single U-tube heat exchanger and a coaxial exchanger both with enhanced grout. The length of the double U-tube heat exchanger with enhanced grout could have a 20\% to 40\% length reduction compared to a conventional U-tube heat exchanger with bentonite grout. The amount of reduction is dependent on parameters for each installation such as soil thermal conductivity.},
