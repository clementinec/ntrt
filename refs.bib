	abstract = {In-situ thermal response tests (TRT) have been carried out on six boreholes in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at the Hope Crossing (Habitat for Humanity) site. The set of boreholes include coaxial and double U-tube heat exchangers, as well as conventional U-tube heat exchangers. This TRT study is a part of a larger project, where the boreholes are connected to ground source heat pumps to cool and heat homes. The TRT study is the first part of a larger project to evaluate the thermal performance of different types of ground heat exchangers. The TRT tests and subsequent data analyses provide estimates of the soil thermal conductivity and the borehole thermal resistance of each heat exchanger. Potentially the borehole depth and/or number of boreholes can be reduced for an installation if the borehole resistance is lowered. The double U- tube heat exchanger with enhanced grout has the lowest borehole resistance, followed by a single U-tube heat exchanger and a coaxial exchanger both with enhanced grout. The length of the double U-tube heat exchanger with enhanced grout could have a 20\% to 40\% length reduction compared to a conventional U-tube heat exchanger with bentonite grout. The amount of reduction is dependent on parameters for each installation such as soil thermal conductivity.},

	abstract = {Deep borehole heat exchanger (DBHE) is attracting attention intensively owing to much more geothermal extraction, higher efficiency for heat pumps, and lesser land demand compared with shallow borehole heat exchanger. DBHE is usually dipped into several thousand meters in the subsurface, having a complicated heat transfer with surrounding rock–soil. However, the heat transfer characteristics below surface under different conditions are rarely studied. In this study, a numerical model considering the comprehensive effects of geothermal gradients and heat loss from inner pipe was proposed. The model was validated with experimental data and Beier analytical solution. Based on the model, the effects of primary design parameters on the heat transfer performance below surface along the pipe were investigated. The results indicate that temperature at pipe bottom increases with inlet flow rate decreasing, while the heat load cannot be extracted fully to the surface because of the heat loss of inner pipe. When the inlet flow rates decrease from 41.39 to 4.52 m3/h, the heat loss ratio increases from 25.5\% to 63.7\%. It is an effective way of insulating inner pipe to reduce heat loss under low inlet flow rates. Increasing the velocity in inner pipe by lessening the inner pipe diameter can also decline the heat loss well. While by this way, the increasing pumping power resulting from the higher velocity in inner pipe has to be considered. This study is significant to effective optimization of DBHE and energy conservation of buildings.},

	abstract = {The coaxial borehole heat exchanger (CBHE) can effectively develop deep geothermal resources with larger heat exchange area than traditional U-tube BHE. However, few studies focus on its parameters optimization and temperature field dynamic response. Hence, an unsteady-state heat transfer model is established for a deep CBHE. The finite difference method is adopted to solve the model, and the model is validated with experiment data. The effects of key factors on the CBHE performance are comprehensively analyzed. Simulation results depict that the outlet temperature decreases greatly at the initial stage, and then remains relatively stable. There is a critical value for flow rate to obtain higher thermal power with appropriate pressure drop. The insulated pipe can significantly reduce heat dissipation of working fluid in central pipe. There is an optimal insulation length in terms of heat insulation effect and costs. The thermal conductivity of cement sheath has remarkable influence on the thermal process and partial cementing with high thermal conductivity cement is favorable. The temperature field analysis shows that the impact scope is limited, and the temperature in the reservoir before the next heating period would almost recover its original condition, verifying the sustainability of CBHE system.},

	abstract = {Ground source heat pump systems are often coupled to the ground by circulating a fluid through vertical Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHEs). The design of a system requires estimates of the ground thermal conductivity and the borehole thermal resistance, which are usually determined by an in situ thermal response test on a completed borehole. The usual test interpretation methods average the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures and use this mean temperature as the average temperature along the borehole length. This assumption is convenient but does not strictly apply. For a coaxial heat exchanger this paper develops an analytical model for the vertical temperature profiles, which can be used instead of the mean temperature approximation to estimate borehole resistance. The model is verified with measured temperatures on a BHE, where an optical technique allows continuous measurements along a coaxial borehole during a distributed thermal response test. A sensitivity study shows that the proposed method corrects errors in the mean temperature approximation, which overestimates the borehole resistance in a coaxial borehole.},

@article{shrestha_assessment_2018,
	Abstract = {Assessment of suitable locations for a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system based on the groundwater condition of study area is important for its sustainable development. Installation potential of a GSHP system was evaluated for the Aizu Basin, Japan. Firstly, suitability assessment was done for a conventional closed-loop system by preparing a distribution map of heat exchange rates for space heating. Heat exchange rates were higher at the northern and southern areas and lower at the central area, indicating that the northern and southern areas are appropriate for the conventional system. A different type of GSHP system using an artesian well was proposed at the central area because groundwater is flowing in an upward direction and using its heat energy can increase heat exchange rates. Demonstration of this system using an artesian well for space heating resulted in higher heat exchange rates compared to the conventional system. A GSHP system using an artesian well is suitable at the central area, and the conventional one is suitable at the northern and southern areas. Assessment of the installation potential of different types of GSHP system in the same Aizu Basin based on its groundwater condition is unique to this study. It can assist in selecting suitable locations for GSHP system installation and to promote its growth in Japan.},

the experimental data for high Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The
equation is valid for the transition region and for the range of fully

obtain a generally valid heat transfer equation in the form proposed by
Nusselt (1909). An equation of general validity can, however, be derived
by making use of the fundamental form developed by Prandtl (1944) on the

@article{shrestha_assessment_2018,
	Abstract = {Assessment of suitable locations for a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system based on the groundwater condition of study area is important for its sustainable development. Installation potential of a GSHP system was evaluated for the Aizu Basin, Japan. Firstly, suitability assessment was done for a conventional closed-loop system by preparing a distribution map of heat exchange rates for space heating. Heat exchange rates were higher at the northern and southern areas and lower at the central area, indicating that the northern and southern areas are appropriate for the conventional system. A different type of GSHP system using an artesian well was proposed at the central area because groundwater is flowing in an upward direction and using its heat energy can increase heat exchange rates. Demonstration of this system using an artesian well for space heating resulted in higher heat exchange rates compared to the conventional system. A GSHP system using an artesian well is suitable at the central area, and the conventional one is suitable at the northern and southern areas. Assessment of the installation potential of different types of GSHP system in the same Aizu Basin based on its groundwater condition is unique to this study. It can assist in selecting suitable locations for GSHP system installation and to promote its growth in Japan.},

	Abstract = {An equation was derived for the calculation of heat and mass transfer 
coefficients in the case of pipe and channel flow, taking into account
the experimental data for high Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The
equation is valid for the transition region and for the range of fully
developed turbulent flows. It is pointed out that it is not possible to
obtain a generally valid heat transfer equation in the form proposed by
Nusselt (1909). An equation of general validity can, however, be derived
by making use of the fundamental form developed by Prandtl (1944) on the
basis of momentum theory.},
