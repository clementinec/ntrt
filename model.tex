\subsection{Analytical Model}
	%Is it clear that we're trying to demonstrate a model that can be experimentally validated that has geothermal gradient? Is it also clear that we're hoping to conduct CBHE configuration optimization? Is it clear that we also hope to simulate seasonal performance of the CBHE? (The last one is very, very unclear. 
	We will be adapting the analytical model from Beier et al., which was developed to predict the thermal response from a CBHE with known geological parameters. This model was developed to adopt undisturbed ground temperature measurement from fiber optic temperature sensors (also referred to as distributed temperature sensor, or DTS). 
	
	%Explain the method, and the ADAPTION~ using a different reference temperature profile, also re-wrote the code into Python to be used as a class for different configurations to have its performance estimated and validated(use a plot to show its performance comparison?).
	
	%Validation of the analytical model
	
	%Comparison with the constant ground temperature solution
		
	%Thermal resistances. Look at the GTRI report also for a good reference.
\subsection{Analytical Solution}
	For each time step, a new analytical solution can be solved along different t, r and ???(What was this other parameter?)
